# CSE 15L WI 23 Lab Report 1
## 1. Meet your group
Groups will be divided into 6-8 people and will be overseen by a discussion leader. This will be dependent on your seat and for this week's lab, you are free to choose your seat along with your group. Once these groups are formed, open the google doc corresponding to your group number, make sure that it's the right time period along with the right location.

Discuss and write down the answers to the questions below in the google doc
  - What is your name (you can include anything else anyone might want to know like pronouns or a nickname)?
  - What is your major?
  - Pick one of these three to answer for the next one:
    - What is a UCSD club or organization that you're in or interested in?
    - What is your favorite spot on campus so far?
    - What is a little shortcut or trick that you know about UCSD?

## 3. VS Code
Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your respective operating system and install it properly according to the instructions. 
- Once completed, open it up and it should look a little something like this, I already have it downloaded since I have used it for another class so don't worry about the files that I have there, but it should still look similar with maybe some different colors


## 4. Remote Connection

## 5. Run Some Commands
Once you're able to log into the system, try running some of the commands that have been used in class from using both the remote computer and your own personal computer. Report what you see and if there are any differences between any outputs of the operating systems.

Some commands you can try are:
* cd ~
* cd

Once Finished with this step you can exit the terminal doing the following steps:
* Press __Crtl + D__
* Type in the command prompt __exit__
